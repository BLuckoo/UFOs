## **1. Overview**
The objective of this analysis is to build a dynamic web page that will allow readers to get information about UFO sightings. 

The web page is built using HTML, Javascript, CSS and the Bootstrap framework. 

Based on the filters used by the readers, data will be imported from a Javascript file containing the data as Javascript objects. The readers will be able to filter the information based on five different elements, such as date, city, state, country and shape of the sightings.

The pertinent information about the sightings will then be presented in the form of a table using Javascript on the web page.

## **2. Results**

The webpage starts with a nice picture of the night sky and a short introduction of the subject by Dr. Olivier, the well-known Ufologist.

The filters used for the search fileds use a Javascript listener on each field. Every time the reader hit enter on any of the filter search the table is updated to display the information in an HTML table on the page.

As the readers scroll down, they will see all the data and filters that are available (which is in the image below).

The readers can enter their search criteria in any or multiple filters in the filter boxes. 
Once the reader hits ENTER, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. 

## **3. Summary**

This web page is clean, simple, appealing and informative for the readers. The filters allow the readers to look at the specific information they are searching.

However, the comments in the data set could be more informative with better descriptions as well as some validation of the information, such as number people witnessing the same sightings.

Improvements that can be made to the web page are as follows:
-   Have a date range grouping to indicate how many sightings within a certain geographic area - this can show some seasonality trends for the sightings.
-   Include a count of sightings based on the different filters, total sightings by date, city, state, country or shape.
